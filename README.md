This service uses convolutional neural networks to generate an imaginary celebrity using a random seed.

This repository was forked from [tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans). The original code and its integration into the SingularityNET both use Python 3.
